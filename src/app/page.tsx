                    <p>Hi! I&apos;m Avery</p>
                    <p>I&apos;m a software engineer based out of Calgary, Alberta. I have over <YearsSince date={new Date("2013/09/01 00:00:00")} includeSuffix /> years of hobbiest programming experience, 
                        and just over <YearsSince date={new Date("2023/05/01 00:00:00")} includeSuffix /> of professional experience. Over my programming career, I have learned a variety of languages,
                        created many personal projects, and have strived to learn as much as possible.</p>
                    <p>My current areas of interest are game development (especially engine development), low level programming (including operating systems and firmware), and theoretical computer science. However,
                        I am always open to learning new technologies and fields when I get the chance.</p>
